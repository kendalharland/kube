><;> Why you should keep headers in include/<project> rather than include/.

You may have a file that conflicts with a stdlib import, like <time.h>.
This conflict doesn't happen if you use <project/time.h> instead.

><;> Why VBO indexing is great

VBO indexing allows you to reuse vertices. In short, to draw a triangle mesh
you'd normally need to specify 3 vertices per triangle even if some of those
those vertices are shared by some triangles. With VBO indexing you can declare
shared vertices once, and specify the index of each vertex in the vertex array
using a separate array of indices. To make this work, you need declare a new
OpenGL GL_ELEMENT_ARRY buffer and load the indices (typically a list of
unsigned int).  You'll also render the vertices using glDrawElements instead
of glDrawArrays.
