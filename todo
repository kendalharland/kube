- Load models directly from obj files
- Render texture coordinates and normals (read about these too).
- Make it impossible to import gl.h before glew.h
- Define a macro to manage move constructors.
- Make the window's background color configurable.
- Define ShaderProgram struct to pass to Graphics::CompileShaderProgram
- Implement some sort of vsync to present screen tearing.
- Don't store shaders on the model. Inject them so you can switch shaders at runtime.
- Create logging macro to throw fatal error.
