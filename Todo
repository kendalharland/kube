1. Make Mesh a struct without methods.
2. Rename OpenGL to Graphics
3. Add functions Graphics::CompileShaderProgram
                 Graphics::LoadMesh (SetupMesh)
                 Graphics::UnloadMesh (TeardownMesh)
4. Move OpenGL::Clear and OpenGL::Update to Window along with all other
   methods that depend on window_
5. Use Window instead of glfw* methods in player.cpp and any other file
   that touches glfw* primitives.
6. Stop holding onto and expose opengl_ in Window.
7. Delete vertex_shader.hpp.
8. Store mesh directly on model since vertices and indices never change.
9. Load models directly from obj files
10. Render texture coordinates and normals (read about these too).
